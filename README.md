# JAGUARS
Welcome to the Jaguar Project! This will be a collaborative learning project where we will work together to create a beautiful website that we can all be proud of and even include in our resumes. This README will be updated as required so please frequently refer back for the latest information on the project. You can find your assigned sections at the bottom of this page but please feel free to discuss further additions with the group! 

***

This is meant to be a **FUN** project and so we are encouraged to think creatively and use our imagination to create whatever we feel like. Some examples could be:
- a game in Javascript
- an artwork using only CSS
- an interactive story
- a fancy custom-designed form
- etc

Of course, we encourage everyone to avoid working autonomously and participate in meetings to propose ideas and additions as if you were in a real-world environment. We have both **#the-jaguar-project** Slack channel and Zoom to facilitate discussion and collaboration so please use them. 

Both myself and Jagadish will be reviewing code and making suggestions on how to improve them but of course, everyone is more than welcome to provide their own suggestions and discuss any changes. In particular, I hope to utilize the "issues" function of GitHub to give everyone some practice assigning themselves to and resolving issues.

I look forward to working with all of you amazing people and I can't wait to see what we can create together! #JAGUARS!
